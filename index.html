        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This is a simple web page to demonstrate the use of CSS for styling. 
                It is styled using an external CSS file, the most recommended way to style web pages.
                The CSS file is linked in the head section of this HTML document.
                The major advantage of using an external CSS file is that it allows you to keep your HTML clean and separate from styling rules.
                This makes it easier to maintain and update the styles without altering the HTML structure.
            </p>
        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
        <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.
            CSS controls the layout of multiple web pages all at once, allowing for consistent styling across a website.
            It can be used to change colors, fonts, spacing, and many other aspects of web design.

            <h2>Why Use CSS?</h2>
            <p>
                CSS is essential for web development because it enhances the visual appeal of web pages and improves user experience.
                It allows developers to create visually engaging designs that are also functional and accessible.
                By separating content from design, CSS makes it easier to manage and update styles without affecting the underlying HTML structure.
            </p>
        <h2>Benefits of Using CSS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Separation of content and style: CSS allows you to keep your HTML structure clean and focused on content.</li>
                <li>Reusability: You can apply the same styles to multiple elements or pages, reducing redundancy.</li>
                <li>Maintainability: Changes to styles can be made in one place, affecting all linked pages.</li>
                <li>Improved loading times: External CSS files can be cached by browsers, speeding up page load times.</li>
                <li>Responsive design: CSS makes it easier to create designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.</li>
            </ul>

         <h2>How to Link CSS to HTML</h2>
            <p>
                To link a CSS file to an HTML document, you use the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML file. 
                For example:
                <pre>
                    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
                </pre>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Basic CSS Syntax</h2>
            <p>
                CSS is made up of selectors and declarations. A selector targets the HTML element you want to style, and a declaration consists of a property and a value.
                Hereâ€™s an example:
            </p>
            <pre>
                p {
                    color: blue;
                    font-size: 16px;
                }
            </pre>
            <p>
                In this example, the selector is `p`, which targets all `<p>` elements, and the declarations set the text color to blue and the font size to 16 pixels.
            </p>
